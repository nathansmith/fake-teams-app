        <p>
          As you get closer to high school graduation, we will play in more tournaments that allow
          you to be seen by collegiate scouts. If you aspire to play at the college level, here is a
          list of regional schools with soccer programs.
        </p>

        <p>
          We encourage you to think long-term and pick a college or university that aligns with your
          educational goals. If you have a school in mind, please let the Frisco Fusion coaching
          staff know. Where applicable, we can help you get in touch with their athletics
          department.
